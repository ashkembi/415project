STATS 415 Final Project

*All code is stored in "final code git.R"*
*Below is my current progress with the code.*

#### Problem 2.1
The code for 2.1 is commented out since it's been completed

#### Problem 2.2
The code for 2.2 is commented out since it's (almost) been completed. Currently, I have a 99.998% on it.
It also runs pretty slow since I used a for-loop to complete it. We can try and develop quicker code if we want

#### Problem 2.3 
The code for 2.3 is pretty much done. We're going to need to tighten up our resulting comments from the code for the report. Also going to need to work on the final plot if we want to make it prettier, but that's not a neccessity.

#### Problem 2.4
The code for 2.4 works but runs pretty slowly (takes like 5 minutes to get the resulting train and validation errors). We can work on making faster code if we want to. All that is left simple code for getting the best $K$ and report the in-sample and out-of-sample correlation, but that is pretty easy code I was waiting on until we maybe come up with a quicker way to run the KNN regression.
